![](./img/3fold_header1.png)

There are 3 main steps to get started

1. Get Yourself a 3Bot Connect
2. Get yourself a hosted Threebot from the marketplace
3. Get yourself some ThreeFold tokens to get started

## TL;DR

If you want to jump right in, use the [Deploy your first solution](getting_started_first_solution.md) tutorial. It will guide you from scratch to deploying your first solution on the grid in a step by step procedure.

## Get Yourself a 3Bot Connect

As a first step, you need to get yourself a **3Bot.connect** identity.  

This can be done by downloading the app on your smartphone and creating yourself an identity.  Please be aware that this is to be your digital identity on the grid, and holds the keys to access it.  The app provides you with access to  ThreeFold social media platforms, has a wallet for managing TFT's and provides support access.  

The app can be found on the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.jimber.threebotlogin&hl=en) and [Apple Appstore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/3bot-connect/id1459845885).

## Get yourself a hosted Threebot from the marketplace

In the second step, follow this doc on how to get your own [hosted threebot](../marketplace/threebot.md)  


## Get yourself some ThreeFold tokens to get started

Last you will need TFT tokens in your **3Bot.connect** app.

There are three type of token available (2020 H1): [FreeTFT](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/tft-stellar/#freetft)'s,  [TFT](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/tft-stellar/#tft)'s and [TFTA](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/tft-stellar/#tfta)'s.

The FreeTFT's is a special token that has been created to allow developers and interested parties to play with the grid for free using free capacity by certain farmers.

Each user is eligible to get 1000 FreeTFT. To claim yours, head to [https://getfreetft.testnet.threefold.io](https://getfreetft.testnet.threefold.io).
