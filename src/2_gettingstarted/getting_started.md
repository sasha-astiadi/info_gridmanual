## High-level Instructions to Get Started


### Get 3Bot Connect App and 3Bot ID

As the first step, you need to get yourself a **3Bot Connect** ID. This could be done by downloading the app on your smartphone and create your own 3Bot Identity. 

Please be aware that this ID is going to be used as your main digital identity on the Threefold Grid, and holds the keys to access every services on the grid. Therefore, it's very important to remember the login data and the seed phrase of your ID. The 3Bot Connect App will also provide you with an access to your 3Bot Wallet where you could store your Threefold Tokens.

 ### Claim your FreeTFT 

__FreeTFT__ is a token especially created to allow developers and early adopters to play with the TF Grid (testnet) for free, by "spending" them on testing environment to purchase capacities provided by certain farmers. Everyone is eligible to get 1000 FreeTFT to start developing your solutions on top of the TF Grid. 

You need to first set up a __testnet wallet__, and a testnet wallet address, so that we could send you some FreeTFT.
