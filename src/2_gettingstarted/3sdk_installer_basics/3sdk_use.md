## Get your 3Bot words

You will be asked the mnemonic words from your 3Bot connect app during installation. Here is how to find them in the app:

- From 3Botconnect application go to settings, then show phrase to get your mnemonics
- Take a note of the 3Bot name and your email
- When registering for the first time you can use these private words in your configurations
- These words are needed, they are your private key.

### Stop Threebot

`threebot stop`

## Advanced features

All the following commands will require you to start `3sdk` with `--expert` flag

### Install New Container

If you do not want to have the interactive wizard, you can specify the different option manually too.

```shell
container install name=someuser identity=someuser email=someuser@gmail.com server=True
```

`server=True` means to start 3Bot server.

### Listing Containers

You can list all the 3Bot container installed on your system using the `container list` command

```shell
3sdk> container list  

list the containers

 - notsomeuser3 : localhost       : threefoldtech/3Bot2       (sshport:9000)
 - notsomeuser4 : localhost       : threefoldtech/3Bot2       (sshport:9010)
 - 3Bot       : localhost         : threefoldtech/3Bot2       (sshport:9020)
3sdk>  
```

Using the `sshport` information you can do `ssh root@localhost -p $SSH_PORT` to manually ssh into the container.

### Start existing Container

To start an existing container:

```shell
container start name=mycontainer
```

### Accessing Container Shell

Either use the sshport info from `container list` command and `ssh root@localhost -p $SSH_PORT` or just execute `container shell` and optionally give it the name of your container

```shell
3sdk> container start name=3Bot
```

### Getting Container Kosmos

Execute `container kosmos` to get into kosmos shell


### Controlling code branches

use `core branch` command to select which branch of the code to use to run your container.
you want to stop restart the container after switching branch to make sure all the processes inside have been properly updated with the new code.
