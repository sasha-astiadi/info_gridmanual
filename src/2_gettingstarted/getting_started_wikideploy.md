# Deploy your first wiki

In this section we will guide you trough publishing your first wiki on the TFGrid.

This tutorial will use the example "chat flows" to deploy the solution. The chat flows are wizards that guide you through different steps asking you questions to help you generate a reservation understandable by the grid.

If you are looking for some example how to do this programmatically, head to the [Develop](code.md) section.
