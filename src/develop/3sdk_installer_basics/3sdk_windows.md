- Git, Install guide [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win), 64-bit version (only for expert mode)

## Configuring Docker

- We need to configure docker to use linux containers during installation and we need to enable file sharing “C” in Docker desktop, It could ask you about in the first time automatically you could allow it directly

## Advanced

If you want to use the `3sdk` in `--expert` mode you need to have the following configured aswell

### Configuring GIT

Git for windows should be configured to be using `LF` line endings instead of windows `CLRF`

Using the following.

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf false
git config --global core.eol lf
```

[source for changing in windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2517190/how-do-i-force-git-to-use-lf-instead-of-crlf-under-windows)

### Configuring SSH and SSH-AGENT

- You may have `ssh-agent` not working on windows you could start it from the windows task manager, head to `services` right click then `start`
as showed in the following

- Then generating a ssh-key as showed below.

```
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521
```

and don't add a passcode, just enter, then

```
ssh-add
```

To make sure the key is loaded you could see it via

```
ssh-add -L
```
