# prepare for running the simulator

## requirements

- [docker desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/#download-and-install) needs to be installed
- [chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) needs to be installed

## supported platforms

today we stupport OSX & most linux flavors.
Windows should be ready soon, check the releases page.

## download your 3sdk tool

- go to https://github.com/threefoldtech/jumpscaleX_core/releases

![](./img/download_./img/3sdk1.png)

download the 3sdk to your local folder.

![](./img/downloaded1.png)

you will see at botomn of your browser the download.

Now start a terminal:

- on OSX: command space terminal (search for terminal)

you will see a terminal like 

![](./img/terminal.png)

do the following in your terminal

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
#list the 3sdk, see its available in Download folder
ls 3sdk*
#give execution permissions to 3sdk
chmod 700 3sdk*
#execute the 3sdk
./3sdk_osx
```

![](./img/dir.png)

when executing the 3sdk you will probably be warned by your operating system that this is an unknown file.

On OSX you will have to go to securyt

- on OSX: command space security  (select security & privacy)

![](./img/security_privacy.png)

you will then see the file you need to allow access for (don't see here because I already allowed the file to run.)

once succesful you will see the following (restart the command 3sdk... in the terminal)

![](./img/3sdk1.png)

now do 'info' to see the commands

![](./img/3sdk2.png)

## Install the simulator

![](./img/install_cmd_3sdk.png)

```bash
#type
simulator start 
```

![](./img/simulator_installing.png)

This will take 1-5 min depending download speed and performance computer.

a browser will open and you will see

![](./img/open_simulator.png)

what you see here is a python notebook visualizing the code of the simulator.

now to go:

- [open the simulator](simulator_open.md)
