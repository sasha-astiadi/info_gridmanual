# TFGrid Simulator

![](./img/simulator_intro.png)

The ThreeFold Grid and Token Simulator allows you to simulate the future behavior of the grid.
It was a tool developed to allow us to develop the tokenomics when we developed our 2nd generation of the farming code.

It allows you to simulate hardware and see how the hardware could potentially behave inside the TF Grid.
