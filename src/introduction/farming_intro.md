## Farming: Putting Capacity Online On The Threefold Grid

### What is a Farmer?
The Threefold Grid is formed by Threefold farmers - individuals or businesses who connect compute and storage hardware (also known as servers) called 3Nodes to the Threefold Grid. The compute and storage capacity of 3Nodes mint [Threefold Tokens](token_what.md) for the Farmer as a reward. Once the farmerâ€™s capacity on the Threefold Grid gets reserved by a user he gets Threefold Tokens. This is called capacity cultivation income.

### Types of Threefold Farmers

There are two types of Threefold Farmers

- Certified Farmer: Buys certified hardware and signs a contract with Threefold Tech for support.
- Do It Yourself (DIY) Farmer: Uses any hardware and in case of support uses online material only.
