## Website Publisher

Publisher is an online decentralised publishing tool that could be used to host wikis, websites, and blogs on top of the Threefold Grid. By creating and hosting your own publishing platform, users will no longer need to depend on centralised, hosted online publishing tools like blogspot, or wordpress.

The expiration time determines how long you would want to keep this website alive on top of the TF Grid.
