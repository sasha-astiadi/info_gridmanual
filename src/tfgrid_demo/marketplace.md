# Introducing: Threefold Grid Demo

![](./img/Homepagelaptop.png)

The Threefold Grid Demo is an inventory platform (on a demo mode) of open source solutions that are built on top of Threefold Grid, accessible by connecting your 3Bot (virtual system administrator) to the platform. 

Its main goal is to enable a simplified solution-deployment on top of the TF Gridâ€™s peer-to-peer cloud, without the necessity of knowledge on rails or Linux shell or any other advance development skills. Via TF Grid Demo, anyone should be able to deploy their solutions and projects on top of the TF Grid.

Threefold Foundation is proud to announce that [TF Grid Demo 2.2](www.demo.grid.tf) is currently live on the testnet environment an alpha version (Aug 2020).
