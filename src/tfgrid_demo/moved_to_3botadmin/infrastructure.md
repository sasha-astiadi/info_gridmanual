The hosted 3Bot gives you the possibility of deploying advanced open-source infrastructure components with the ease and simplicity like no other. Here are some of the open-source infrastructure components for computer applications, scaling, and management now made available for deployment via the hosted 3Bot, easily deployed online via the [3Bot Deployer](deploy3bot.grid.tf):


- [__Network__](network.md): Deploy a network on the grid and to connect your solutions together.
- [__Capacity Pools__](it_capacity.md): The most exciting development from 2.1 version- A feature to reserve capacity on the grid to deploy the solutions on.
- [__3Bot__](3bot.md): Your 3Bot server and system administrator panel - you can now easily deploy your 3Bot Server on a container.
- [__Ubuntu__](ubuntu.md): A free and open-source Linux distribution based on Debian. This package is used to deploy an ubuntu container from an official flist on the grid using a chatflow.
- [__Generic Container__](flist.md): Spawn a container using specific flist provided by the user in the chatflow.
- [__Kubernetes__](kubernetes.md): Deploy a Kubernetes cluster with zdb using a chatflow; a full-blown kubernetes cluster on the TF grid. 
- [__S3 Storage__](minio.md): MinIO is a high performance object storage. Deploy a machine with MinIO along with the number of zdbs needed for storage.
- [__Monitoring__](monitoring.md): A monitoring system that includes Prometheus, Grafana, and redis
- [__Publisher__](publisher.md):
- [Solution Expose](exposed.md): Expose a deployed solution using the web gateway
- [__Domain Delegation__](delegated_domain.md): Point your domain to a capacity pool / gateway.
- [__4 to 6 Gateway__](4to6gw.md): Provides access to IPv6 addresses for users with IPv4 networks only through a Wireguard tunnel.
