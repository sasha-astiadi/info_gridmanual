# Farm Management & Setup

In this section, you will find everything you need to know about how to get started for farming:

* Creating a Farm
* Creating a 0-OS Bootable Image
* Booting Your 3Node
* Managing Your Farm & Nodes
* Manage your farm wallet

If you have any questions head to your [Farming Section on the Forum](https://forum.Threefold.io/c/Threefold-grid-support/farmer-discussion)

## Set up a farm

This document shows how to set up your Threefold Farm and 3Nodes. 

### Prerequisite

This document assume you have a 3Bot up and running. If you don't have one yet, head to the [Get a 3Bot section](getting_started_3bot.md) of this manual before continuing.

### Install the Farm Management Application

Next step is to install the farm management application. To do so, click the `Farm Management` tab on the left side menu.
Then click `Install required packages` button

![install_package](./img/install_packages.png)

Once the package is installed, the page will reload the `farm management` UI will appear.

### Create a TF Farm

**Important**:
Before creating farm, makes sure your 3Bot is configure to use the network you want to use. The Threefold Grid has 2 different networks, Mainnet and Testnet. If you want to learn more about the difference and how to configure your 3Bot to use one or the other, have a look at [Grid Networks]() TODO the section of the manual.

Now that your 3Bot is properly configured, you are ready to create your farm. To create a new farm, click the little plus button on the top left corner:

![add farm](./img/add_farm.png)

It will open up a form to create a new Farm:

![new farm](./img/new_farm.png)

Let's go over each field an explain what they are:

* **Farm name**: This is the name you want to give to your farm. The name can be changed at any time and is just there to make it easier for user to find your farm.
* **Organization ID**: This field is only useful is you are migrating a farm from the TFGrid v1. If you are creating a new farm from scratch, you can ignore it.
* **Email address**: The email address you want to use when information to farmer needs to be communicated or when you received notification about your farming token being distributed.
* **Country**: This field is optional but usually you want users to know where you farm is located so they can pick nodes that are closer to them.
* **Wallet addresses**: This is where you specify the address of your wallet where the user will send money when buying capacity and when farming token are generated by your nodes. At the time of writing, there are 3 supported tokens: [TFT](https://wiki.threefold.io/#/terms_conditions_griduser?id=_5-use-of-threefold-tokens), [TFTA](https://wiki.threefold.io/#/terms_conditions_griduser?id=_5-use-of-threefold-tokens) and [FreeTFT](https://manual2.threefold.io/#/getting_started?id=claim-your-freetft). You can use any wallet to generate your addresses, you just need to make sure the right [trust line](https://www.stellar.org/developers/guides/concepts/assets.html) are created.

**Make sure you add a valid TFT stellar address. This is required in order for user to be able to reserve capacity from your farm.**

Once the farm is created you should see a new entry in the top table.

Notice the first column of the table: ID. This is your farm ID, write this down cause you will need to use it when generating the 0-OS image for you the nodes of you farm.

### Create a Bootable Image

At this point you should have created your farm and noted its ID. The next step is to generate a bootable image of 0-OS to boot your nodes.

The bootstrap service: https://bootstrap.grid.tf is there for you to generate your 0-OS images.
In the bootstrap wizard, enter your farm ID:

![boostrap farmer ID](./img/bootstap_farmid.png)

Choose you network:

If you want to run your node on Mainnet, select Production
If you want to run your node on Testnet, select Testing
If you want to run your node on Devnet, select Development

If you are not sure what to use, select Production.

![boostrap network selection](./img/bootstap_network.png)

Lastly download the generated image. There are multiple format of image available. Pick the one most appropriate for your setup.

You are now ready to boot your nodes!

### Start 3Node with Bootable Image

After booting your 3Node, you should see something similar to 

![0-OS console interface](./img/zui.png)

And if you go back to your farm management page, you should also now see your nodes being part of your farm.

If you don't see the console or if you nodes never appears in the farm management view, then most probably something is going wrong during the boot of the 3Node. In that case please head to the [forum](https://forum.threefold.io/c/technical-discussion/zero-os/8) or the [0-OS dev channel](https://t.me/zero_os_tech) to seek some help.
