# 3Bot Wallets

![](./img/3bot_wallet.png)

Your 3Bot comes in handy with a built-in __Stellar wallets__, listing all your existing stellar wallets, with the option to create a new wallet or import an existing ones. This feature was especially made with the aim to make it easier and faster for you to reserve and pay for your IT Capacity. 

Please keep in mind that a testnet wallet could only send and receive transactions within the test network, the same way with how a mainnet wallet could only send and receive transactions within the main network.


## Creating a New Wallet

Can be created from the create button in Wallets page
