![](./img/3bot_wallet.png)

Your hosted 3Bot comes in handy with a built-in __hosted 3Bot Wallets feature__, listing all your existing 3Bot wallets, with the option to create a new wallet and extend your existing ones. This feature was especially made with the aim to make it easier and faster for you to reserve and pay for your IT Capacity. 

Please keep in mind that a testnet wallet could only send and receive transactions within the test network, the same way with how a mainnet wallet could only send and receive transactions within the main network.
