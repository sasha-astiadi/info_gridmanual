# Introducing: Capacity Pools

Capacity Pool is one of the most exciting features made available on TF Grid 2.2 (Testnet) version- A feature to reserve capacity on the grid to deploy your solutions on.

By doing just a few clicks, you will be able to reserve IT Capacity for your projects directly by creating multiple capacity pools. 

You could directly order the capacity from your chosen farms, simply by putting the amount of Storage Unit (SU) and Capacity Unit (CU) you need, and conduct a direct payment via your stellar wallet for your reservation. You will be able to also extend your current capacity pool to a larger quote once itâ€™s activated.

You could now already try to reserve IT Capacity by using FreeTFT on TF Grid Demo 2.2 (Testnet).
