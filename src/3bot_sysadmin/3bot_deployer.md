# Get a Hosted 3Bot

Simplifying the deployment experience on top of the Threefold Grid has been a priority for Threefold since we launched the 3Bot SDK. We are now creating an even better, more user-friendly experience by allowing users to deploy their 3Bot online on a hosted environment. The 3Bot Admin Panel is a versatile platform to administrate, monitor, and control processes and activities on top of the Threefold Grid.

## How to Deploy a Hosted 3Bot

Go to [3Bot Deployer Website](https://deploy3bot.grid.tf)


### Name Your 3Bot

This name will be used to identify this 3Bot. Keep in mind that this name would also be used as your 3Bot's subdomain (a part of your 3bot's web address that will be used to access it).

### Choose the 3Bot's Expiration Time

The expiration time determines your preference on how long you would want to keep this 3Bot alive on top of the TF Grid. This will also calculate the amount of the internet capacity you would need to purchase to keep the 3Bot online. No worries, you could always extend your 3Bot's living span by extending your capacity.

### Pay for Your Capacity by using a Stellar Wallet

You will be shown a payment details as below. Send the required amount to the mentioned address on your screen by using a stellar wallet. Please do not forget to mention the reservation ID on the memo text section when you're sending your payment. The memo text is used to identify a payment. Sending a payment without a memo-text could result in a failed transaction.
##### Remark: 
If you are working on the mainnet of the Threefold grid, TFT are to be used for payment on the Stellar mainnet. 
The testnet of the TFGrid is connected to the Stellar testnet, so also testnet tokens are to be used.
