# Get a Hosted 3Bot

Simplifying the deployment experience on top of the Threefold Grid has been a priority for Threefold since we launched the 3Bot SDK. We are now creating an even better, more user-friendly experience by allowing users to deploy their 3Bot online on a hosted environment. The 3Bot Admin Panel is a versatile platform to administrate, monitor, and control processes and activities on top of the Threefold Grid.

## How to Deploy a Hosted 3Bot

- For mainnet hosted 3Bot Go to [3Bot Deployer Website](https://deploy3bot.grid.tf)
- For testnet hosted 3Bot Go to [3Bot Deployer Website For Testnet](https://deploy3bot.testnet.grid.tf)

### Difference between 3Bot on Mainnet and 3Bot on Testnet
- Testnet 3Bot is meant for testing and playing around. uses no real value token (Testnet TFT) and limited by the resources of testnet network and mainly used for testing things out)
- Mainnet 3Bot is using real tokens with value on TFGrid 

You get the same experience, but your 3bot will object to limitation on testnet network.


### Name Your 3Bot

This name will be used to identify this 3Bot. Keep in mind that this name would also be used as your 3Bot's subdomain (a part of your 3bot's web address that will be used to access it).

### Choose the 3Bot's Expiration Time

The expiration time determines your preference on how long you would want to keep this 3Bot alive on top of the TF Grid. This will also calculate the amount of the internet capacity you would need to purchase to keep the 3Bot online. No worries, you could always extend your 3Bot's living span by extending your capacity.

### Pay for Your Capacity by using a Stellar Wallet

You will be shown a payment details as below. Send the required amount to the mentioned address on your screen by using a stellar wallet. Please do not forget to mention the reservation ID on the memo text section when you're sending your payment. The memo text is used to identify a payment. Sending a payment without a memo-text could result in a failed transaction.
##### Remark: 
If you are working on the mainnet of the Threefold grid, TFT are to be used for payment on the Stellar mainnet. 
The testnet of the TFGrid is connected to the Stellar testnet, so also testnet tokens are to be used.
