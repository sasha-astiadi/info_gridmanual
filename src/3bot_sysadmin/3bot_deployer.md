# Get a Hosted 3Bot

Simplifying the deployment experience on top of the Threefold Grid has been a priority for Threefold since we launched the 3Bot SDK. We are now creating an even better, more user-friendly experience by allowing users to deploy their 3Bot online on a hosted environment. The 3Bot Admin Panel is a versatile platform to administrate, monitor, and control processes and activities on top of the Threefold Grid.

## How to Deploy a Hosted 3Bot

Go to [3Bot Deployer Website](https://deploy3bot.grid.tf)


### Name Your 3Bot

This name will be used to identify this 3Bot. Keep in mind that this name would also be used as your 3Bot's subdomain (a part of your 3bot's web address that will be used to access it).

### Choose the 3Bot's Expiration Time

The expiration time determines your preference on how long you would want to keep this 3Bot alive on top of the TF Grid. This will also calculate the amount of the internet capacity you would need to purchase to keep the 3Bot online. No worries, you could always extend your 3Bot's living span by extending your capacity.
