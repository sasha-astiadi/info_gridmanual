# Threefold Grid Manual

![](./img/storage_compute.png)

Hi! Welcome to the __TF Grid Manual__, the knowledge base for those interested in learning more about deploying a network and solutions on top of the __TF Grid__ via [__TF Grid Demo__](https://demo.testnet.grid.tf/), [__Hosted 3Bot__](https://deploy3bot.grid.tf/) or a [__Local 3Bot__](3bot_local_install.md). 

## Navigate Your Way on the Manual

- [__Introduction__](learn.md)
- [__Getting Started__](getting_started.md)
- [__TF Grid Demo__](threefold_now.md)
- [__3Bot__](3bot.md)
- [__Advance Development__](develop.md)


The Manual is sectioned into 5 major sections to cater to each of these different actions in the TF Grid Ecosystem. If you're interested in learning about the Threefold Ecosystem, see the [__Introduction__](learn.md) section.

To learn all the basics you would need to complete before deploying a solution on top of the TF Grid, head over to the [__Getting Started__](getting_started.md) section of the Manual. 

Feel free to try deploying all available built-in TF Grid solutions (demo) on testnet and easy deployment manuals via [__TF Grid Demo__](threefold_now.md) section. 

If you're interested in deploying a cloud solution project on top of TF Grid (both on mainnet or testnet), you would need to firstly run a 3Bot locally (local 3Bot) or online on a hosted environment (hosted 3Bot). Feel free to check [__3Bot__](3bot.md) section to read more about 3Bot. 

If you're interested in more advanced technical hand-outs on cloud infrastructure solution deployment, please check out our [__Advance Development__](develop.md) guide section. It will guide you from scratch on how to deploy your first cloud infrasturcture solution on the grid by using primitives on step-by-step procedures.

## TF Grid: Where Are We Now?


### Introducing TF Grid 2.2

```
Release Stats (Sept 2020)

- Threefold Grid

```

In brief, the Threefold Grid is composed of two different types of public networks environments; Mainnet (production), Testnet (Staging).

The latest versions of Zero-OS (TF Grid’s operating system) and their associated new features are first deployed to the  ‘Testnet’ for testing, before eventually being released on the ‘Mainnet’ grid. Any farmer and partner will be able to choose to run their node on any of the 3 networks, by configuring their Zero-OS boot process accordingly.

We’ve been working hard to make it even easier for projects to deploy cloud infrastructure solutions on top of the TF Grid with the new [__Hosted 3Bot__](3bot.md); by enabling solution deployments on a hosted environment, as well as providing a demo platform where end-users can easily deploy open-source solutions on top of the TF Grid via [__TF Grid Demo__](threefold_now.md). The ThreeFold Now Demo is currently only available for testing on testnet.

 __TF Grid 2.2.0__ is released for porduction on Mainnet and is also existing on testnet as a testing environment. This latest release of __TF Grid 2.2.0__ includes certain exciting features like the Capacity Pools- where you could order IT capacity for your project directly from the farms via 3Bot Admin Panel dashboard. This feature is currently available as a part of your hosted 3Bot that you could deploy online from [the 3Bot Deployer](https://deploy3bot.grid.tf/). 

Since __hosted 3Bot__ is a newly-released feature at Threefold, this is where we hope you could contribute as a __TF Grid Alpha Tester__ and try to build your cloud infrastructure solutions on. This manual also aims to serve as your how-to guide on easy eopen-source solution deployment by using __TF Grid Demo__.
