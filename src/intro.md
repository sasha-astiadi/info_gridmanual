# Threefold Grid 2.2 (Tesnet) Manual

![](./img/storage_compute.png)

Hi! Welcome to the __TF Grid 2.2 (Testnet) Manual wiki__, a knowledge base for those interested in learning more about deploying a network and solutions on top of the __TF Grid 2.2 Testnet Environment__ via TF Grid's [__Testnet Marketplace__](marketplace-testnet.grid.tf). 

## Navigate Your Way on the Manual

The Manual is sectioned into three major sections to cater to each of these different actions in the TF Grid Ecosystem. If you're interested in learning about the Threefold Ecosystem, see the [__Introduction__](learn.md) section. To learn all the basics you would need to deploy a solutions on top of the TF Grid, head over to the [__Getting Started__](#getting_started.md) section of the Manual. Feel free to check all available solutions and easy deployment manuals by using TF Marketplace on [__Threefold Grid Marketplace__](marketplace.md) section. If you're interested in more advanced technical hand-outs on deployment, check out our [__Advanced Development__](develop.md) section. It will guide you from scratch to deploying your first solution on the grid in a step by step procedure using provisioning codes and primitives.

If you're looking for an introduction to Threefold in general, please go to our main [Threefold Wiki](wiki.Threefold.io)

In brief, the Threefold Grid is composed of three different types of networks environments; Mainnet (production), Testnet (Staging), and Dev (Development). 

The latest versions of 0-OS (TF Grid’s operating system) and their associated new features are first deployed for testing to the ‘Devnet’ and ‘Testnet’, before being released on the ‘Mainnet’ grid. Any farmer and partner will be able to choose to run their node on any of the 3 networks, by configuring their 0-OS boot process accordingly.

We’ve been working hard to make it even easier for projects to deploy solutions on top of the grid with the new __TF Grid Marketplace; enabling projects to deploy solutions on a hosted environment. 

Currently TF Grid Marketplace 2.1 is released on Mainnet. Our next release - __TF Grid 2.2 Marketplace__ - will include certain exciting features like the Capacity Pools- where you could order IT capacity on the dashboard for your project directly from the farms. This feature is currently only available on the [__TF Grid Marketplace 2.2 (testnet)__](marketplace-testnet2.grid.tf). this is where we hope you could contribute as a __Testnet alpha tester__ and try to build your solutions on and this manual is aimed to serve as your how-to on deploying solutions using TF Grid Marketplace 2.2 (testnet).

## Testnet vs MainNet

Below is a diagram that will help you understand the difference in between the testnet version and the mainnet version of the TF Grid Marketplace.
