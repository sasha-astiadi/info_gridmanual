In brief, the Threefold Grid is composed of three different types of networks environments; Mainnet (production), Testnet (Staging), and Dev (Development). 

The latest versions of 0-OS (TF Grid’s operating system) and their associated new features are first deployed for testing to the ‘Devnet’ and ‘Testnet’, before being released on the ‘Mainnet’ grid. Any farmer and partner will be able to choose to run their node on any of the 3 networks, by configuring their 0-OS boot process accordingly.

We’ve been working hard to make it even easier for projects to deploy solutions on top of the grid with the new __TF Grid Marketplace; enabling projects to deploy solutions on a hosted environment. 

Currently TF Grid Marketplace 2.1 is released on Mainnet. Our next release - __TF Grid 2.2 Marketplace__ - will include certain exciting features like the Capacity Pools- where you could order IT capacity on the dashboard for your project directly from the farms. This feature is currently only available on the [__TF Grid Marketplace 2.2 (testnet)__](marketplace-testnet2.grid.tf). this is where we hope you could contribute as a __Testnet alpha tester__ and try to build your solutions on and this manual is aimed to serve as your how-to on deploying solutions using TF Grid Marketplace 2.2 (testnet).
