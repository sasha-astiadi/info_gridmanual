## Get TFT

You have three options for getting / purchasing TFT

1. From a public exchange *(some country limitations)*
2. Directly from a ThreeFold Farmer
3. Through Stellar decentralized exchanges

- If you have experience with digital currencies
    - We recommend you go through one of the public exchanges if those are available in your country. 
    - Or use Stellar decentralized exchanges.
- If you do not have experience with digital currencies
    - We suggest you buy TFT from a TF Farmer

_Keep in mind buying digital currencies through exchanges does involve some steps and time, but in the end this is because there is an exchange of money happening â€“ so security, verification of identity, and related procedures are quite important._
