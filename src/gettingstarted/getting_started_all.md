# Getting Started

To get started and deploy a solution on top of the TF Grid, you would need to first figure out of whether you would like to build on top of the __TF Grid Testnet__ or __TF Grid Mainnet__. In brief, The TF Grid Mainnet is the product we're launching for widescale use, and the Testnet is the network used to test all the functionality of the Msainnet. 

please go back to the [__TF Grid: Where Are We Now?__](https://manual.threefold.io/#/?id=tf-grid-where-are-we-now) section on the homepage to learn more in depth about TF Grid's current state of releases and the difference in between TF Grid Mainnet and Testnet.

With that in mind, we have prepared a detailed guidance for the two separate cases.

- Go to [__Start on Mainnet__](getting_started_mainnet.md) to read the manual on how to get started on using TF Grid's mainnet
- Go to [__Start on Testnet__](getting_started_testnet.md) to read the manual on how to get started on using TF Grid's testnet

> Please keep in mind that the two networks are completely separated, and thus every activity done on testnet cannot be applied to the mainnet, and vice versa. For example, You would not be able to purchase capacity on TF Grid mainnet by using the testnet TFT you have on your testnet wallet.
