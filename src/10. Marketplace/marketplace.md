# Introducing: Threefold Grid Marketplace

![](./img/Homepagelaptop.png)

The Threefold Grid Marketplace is an inventory platform of open source solutions that are built on top of Threefold Grid, accessible by connecting your 3Bot (virtual system administrator) to the platform. 

Its main goal is to enable a simplified solution-deployment on top of the TF Gridâ€™s peer-to-peer cloud, without the necessity of knowledge on rails or Linux shell or any other advance development skills. Via the Marketplace, anyone should be able to deploy their solutions and projects on top of the TF Grid.

## TF Grid Marketplace Current State

Threefold Foundation is proud to announce that [TF Grid Marketplace 2.2](www.marketplace-testnet.grid.tf) is currently live on the testnet environment an alpha version (Aug 2020).

On its alpha version on Testnet, there are already several open-source solutions deployed on top of the Threefold Grid, covering various fields from data storage, online publisher, and many more to come. 

### Advanced Solutions

- [Network](network.md): Deploy a network on the grid and to connect your solutions together.
- [Capacity Pools][it_capacity.md]: The most exciting development from 2.1 version- A feature to reserve capacity on the grid to deploy the solutions on.
- [3Bot Server](3bot.md): Your 3Bot server and system administrator panel - you can now easily deploy your 3Bot Server on a container.
- [Ubuntu](ubuntu.md): A free and open-source Linux distribution based on Debian. This package is used to deploy an ubuntu container from an official flist on the grid using a chatflow.
- [Generic Container](generic_container.md): Generic Container: Spawn a container using specific flist provided by the user in the chatflow.
- [Kubernetes](k8s.md): Deploy a Kubernetes cluster with zdb using a chatflow; a full-blown kubernetes cluster on the TF grid. 
- [Minio](minio.md): MinIO is a high performance object storage. Deploy a machine with MinIO along with the number of zdbs needed for storage.
- [Monitoring](monitoring.md): A monitoring system that includes Prometheus, Grafana, and redis
- [Publisher](publisher.md):
- [Gitea](gitea.md): Self-hosted Git service. It is similar to GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab.
- [Solution Expose](solution_expose.md): Expose a deployed solution using the web gateway
- [Domain Delegation](domain_delegation.md): Point your domain to a capacity pool / gateway.
- [4to6 Gateway](4to6gateway.md): Provides access to IPv6 addresses for users with IPv4 networks only through a Wireguard tunnel.


### End-user Solutions

Say goodbye to centralized cloud hosting. Of whether you need a P2P alternative to a website, a forum, or a video platform for your project; by connecting your 3Bot ID to the Marketplace 2.2 (testnet) dashboard, you could now become your own server and deploy these open-source solutions on TF Grid:

- Peertube: is an open-source video platform that uses peer-to-peer tech to reduce load on individual servers when viewing videos. 
- Discourse: is an open source forum built to educate members about civil community engagement. 
- Mattermost: Mattermost is an open source Slack-alternative messaging platform that enables secure team collaboration
- Cryptpad: CryptPad is a fully-secured, encrypted alternative to popular office tools and cloud services. 
- Blog: P2P alternative to Tumblr or Blogspot. 
- Website:  P2P alternative to centralized cloud-hosted websites. Host your own website with access via an IP and a public domain.
- Wiki: Host your own wiki with access via an IP and a public domain.

With your help and with the help of our community, we aim to become the biggest reference for open source project directory. We are open for collaborations, and we are actively looking for early adopters and curious minds to contribute to the growth of the project by [deploying your own network](#getting_started_network.md), [developing your own solutions](getting_started_first_solution.md), or simply by becoming one of TF Grid Marketplace alpha testers!
