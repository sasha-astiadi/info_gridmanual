# Introducing: Threefold Grid Marketplace

![](./img/Homepagelaptop.png)

The Threefold Grid Marketplace is an inventory platform of open source solutions that are built on top of Threefold Grid, accessible by connecting your 3Bot (virtual system administrator) to the platform. 

Its main goal is to enable a simplified solution-deployment on top of the TF Gridâ€™s peer-to-peer cloud, without the necessity of knowledge on rails or Linux shell or any other advance development skills. Via the Marketplace, anyone should be able to deploy their solutions and projects on top of the TF Grid.

## TF Grid Marketplace Current State

Threefold Foundation is proud to announce that [TF Grid Marketplace 2.2](www.marketplace-testnet.grid.tf) is currently live on the testnet environment an alpha version (Aug 2020).

On its alpha version on Testnet, there are already open-source solutions deployed on top of the Threefold Grid, covering various fields from data storage, online publisher, and many more to come. 

- Feel free to go to [Apps Solutions](apps.md) to see the current state and list of open-source applications and end-user solutions deployable via the Marketplace, such as Peertube, Mattermost, and many more.
- Feel free to go to [Infrastructure Solutions](apps.md) to see the current state and list of open-source infrastructure components for computer application deployment, scaling, and management now made available for deployment via the Marketplace.

With your help and with the help of our community, we aim to become the biggest reference for open source project directory. We are open for collaborations, and we are actively looking for early adopters and curious minds to contribute to the growth of the project by [deploying your own network](#getting_started_network.md), [developing your own solutions](getting_started_first_solution.md), or simply by becoming one of TF Grid Marketplace alpha testers!
