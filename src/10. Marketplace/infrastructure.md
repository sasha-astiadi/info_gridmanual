The TF Grid Marketplace gives you the possibility of deploying advanced open-source infrastructure components with the ease and simplicity like no other. Here are some of the open-source infrastructure components for computer applications, scaling, and management now made available for deployment via the Marketplace:


- [__Network__](network.md): Deploy a network on the grid and to connect your solutions together.
- [__Capacity Pools__](it_capacity.md): The most exciting development from 2.1 version- A feature to reserve capacity on the grid to deploy the solutions on.
- [__3Bot__](3bot.md): Your 3Bot server and system administrator panel - you can now easily deploy your 3Bot Server on a container.
- [__Ubuntu__](ubuntu.md): A free and open-source Linux distribution based on Debian. This package is used to deploy an ubuntu container from an official flist on the grid using a chatflow.

- [__Publisher__](publisher.md):
- [__Gitea__](gitea.md): Self-hosted Git service. It is similar to GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab.
- [Solution Expose](exposed.md): Expose a deployed solution using the web gateway
- [__Domain Delegation__](domain_delegation.md): Point your domain to a capacity pool / gateway.
- [__4to6 Gateway__](4to6gw.md): Provides access to IPv6 addresses for users with IPv4 networks only through a Wireguard tunnel.
