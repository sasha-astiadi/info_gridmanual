![](./img/storage_compute.png)

Welcome to the __TF Grid Manual wiki__, a knowledge base for those interested in learning more about the Threefold Grid Ecosystem, deploying a network, and developing solutions on top of the TF Grid.

## Getting started

The wiki is sectioned into three major sections to cater to each of these different actions in the TF Grid Ecosystem. If you're interested in learning about the Threefold Ecosystem, see the [introduction](#intro) section. to start deploying a network, head over to the  [Deploy a Network](#getting_started_network.md) section. If you're interested in developing your first solution on top of the TF Grid right away, and get it listed as a solution on [Threefold Grid Marketplace](#marketplace), check out the [Develop a Solution](getting_started_first_solution.md) section. It will guide you from scratch to deploying your first solution on the grid in a step by step procedure.

If you're looking for an introduction to Threefold in general, please go to our main [Threefold Wiki](wiki.threefold.io)
